 * This is a very simple problem: return true if the flowers have and odd and an even number (which means they are in love) or return false if both have flowers with odd
 * or even number of petals.

//Codewars solution: 
public class OppositesAttract {

  public static boolean isLove(final int flower1, final int flower2) {
    return ((flower1 % 2) != (flower2 % 2)) ? true : false;
  }
  
}

//If you want to see an example running in your JDK:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int flower1 = 5;
        int flower2 = 9;

        //Solution 1: compact if method
        System.out.println(((flower1 % 2) != (flower2 % 2)) ? "They are in love!" : "They aren't in love");

        //Solution 2: if method
        if((flower1 % 2) != (flower2 % 2))
            System.out.println("They are in love!");
        else
            System.out.println("They aren't in love");
    }
}
