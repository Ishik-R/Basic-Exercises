/* 8 kyu - Will there be enough space?

 *
 *  Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he 
 * sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.
 *
 * You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:
 *
 *    - cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
 *    - on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
 *    - wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
 * 
 * If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
 *
