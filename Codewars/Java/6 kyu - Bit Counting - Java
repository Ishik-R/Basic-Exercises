//6 kyu - Bit Counting
//Java
//https://www.codewars.com/kata/526571aae218b8ee490006f4/train/java
//
//Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that 
//input is non-negative.
//
//Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

public class BitCounting {

	public static int countBits(int n){
    int c = 0;
    
		while(n >= 1){
			if(n%2 == 1) 
        c += 1;
			n = n/2;
		}
    
    return c;
	}
}
