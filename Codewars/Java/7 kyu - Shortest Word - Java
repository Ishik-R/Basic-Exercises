/* 7 kyu - Shortest Word
 * https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cebe1dc6fdc20c57000ac9/train/java
 * Java
 *
 * Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).
 *
 * NA: I think that I'm no going to post the Codewars solution in my files from this point foward. The intention of Codewars is to give challenges, so if I keep posting
 * them I can ruin the experience for the others. I'm supposed to post great projects in my Github, but for the time being, I want to keep posting my daily exercises.
 * Maybe in the future I can add more variety and stop post every Codewars Kata.

//My solution:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "Let's travel abroad shall we";
        String[] separatedWords = s.split(" ");
        String shortestWord = separatedWords[0];

        for(int i = 1; i < separatedWords.length; i++){
            if (separatedWords[i].length() < shortestWord.length())
                shortestWord = separatedWords[i];
        }

        System.out.printf("Shortest word: %s, with length of %d ", shortestWord, shortestWord.length());
    }
}
