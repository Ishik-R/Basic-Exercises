/* 7 kyu - Cheat at rock paper scissors! 
 * https://www.codewars.com/kata/57e141ad8a8b8d4d150004f6
 * Java
 *
 * You seem to have the worst luck at rock, paper, scissors! Everyday you play against your friends, but never win. You want a taste of victory!
 * In this kata you need to define r_p_s_cheat() that takes an argument, either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' and returns your counter to win!
 * But there's a catch! Your friends know how terrible you are at rock, paper, scissors, and if you win all of the time, then they'll see through your deception!
 * You need r_p_s_cheat to win 88-92% of the time and lose 8-12% of the time! In other words, you should never tie!
 *
 * NA: this challenge is only available in Python at Codewars, but i made a algorithm in Java that is capable of fullfuil its requirements. You can play against the
 * machine yourself and the machine will have a 90% chance of winning!
