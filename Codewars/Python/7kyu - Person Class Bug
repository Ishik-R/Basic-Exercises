7kyu - Person Class Bug
https://www.codewars.com/kata/513f887e484edf3eb3000001/train/python
Python

The following code was thought to be working properly, however when the code tries to access the age of the person instance it fails.

person = Person('Yukihiro', 'Matsumoto', 47)
print(person.full_name)
print(person.age)
For this exercise you need to fix the code so that it works correctly.

Note: the order of the person's full name is first name and last name.
'''

class Person():

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.full_name = f'{self.first_name} {self.last_name}'
        self.age = age
