//A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! 
//Each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.
//Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?
//Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

def hero(bullets, dragons):
    if bullets >= 2*dragons:
        return True
    else:
        return False
