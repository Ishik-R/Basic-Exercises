'''
5kyu - First non-repeating character
https://www.codewars.com/kata/52bc74d4ac05d0945d00054e/train/python
Python

Write a function named first_non_repeating_letterâ€  that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.

If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("");

*Note: the function is called firstNonRepeatingLetter for historical reasons, but your function should handle any Unicode character.
