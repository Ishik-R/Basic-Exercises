6kyu - first character that repeats
https://www.codewars.com/kata/54f9f4d7c41722304e000bbb/train/python
Python

Find the first character that repeats in a String and return that character.

first_dup('tweet') => 't'
first_dup('like') => None
This is not the same as finding the character that repeats first. In that case, an input of 'tweet' would yield 'e'.

        if s.count(letter)>1:return letter
    return None

print(first_dup('tweetrd'))
