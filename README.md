# Basic-Exercises
This repository is supposed to host the exercises i've completed in my initial process of learning

02/05/2021 - CREATION OF REPOSITORY
 I've already made some exercises but i haven't updated them here, so I'll start to upload them here; I'll mostly post exercises in Python and Java. At this moment, Python is my main interest because I'm interested in Data Science, but since my girlfriend is also learning to program I'm also helping her. My previous experiences in programming (because in Physics I've learn the basics concepts of programming in C++, Fortran, LaTex and MatLab, but since I never put this knowledge in pratice I've forgot most of them) are very helpful to her.
