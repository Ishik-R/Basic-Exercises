# Basic-Exercises
This repository is supposed to host the exercises i've completed in my initial process of learning

### *02/05/2021 - CREATION OF REPOSITORY*
 I've already made some exercises but i haven't updated them here, so I'll start to upload them here; I'll mostly post exercises in Python and Java. At this moment, Python is my main interest because I'm interested in Data Science, but since my girlfriend is also learning to program I'm also helping her. My previous experiences in programming (because in Physics I've learn the basics concepts of programming in C++, Fortran, LaTex and MatLab, but since I never put this knowledge in pratice I've forgot most of them) are very helpful to her.
 
### *29/05/2021 - UPDATE ON EXERCISES*
 I've finished updating all exercises I've done till this very moment. I'm very busy because I've just finished moving from another city and I've stabilized my situation with my final paper, so I expect to put some more time in my studies in programming in the next weeks.

### *30/09/2021 - RETURNING*
 I've left my programming routine aside in the last 3 months. It was a rough period of moving to a totally new city, and at this very moment I'm writing my final paper. Incentivied by my girlfriend and in doubt about working in the education field I'm returning to study programmation.
 
### *16/11/2021 - RETURNING*
 After some weeks working on my final paper, a proposal of a new job and many other things, I'm returning to post more frequently in my GitHub. I'm still studying, taking some free courses at Digital Innovation One (DIO) and Allura. Some exercises in the near future will come from them.
  
### *31/05/2022 - FINISHED MY GRADUATION*
 I've been through some rough months. The elaboration of my TCC ("Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso") was very convoluted, but in the end I finally graduated, but the stress have severelly taken its toll on me. Now I'm rebuilding my confidence and self-steem to do my tasks. Even some hobbies I used to do for fun were harmed and descontinued. This returning after several months is the affirmation that my mental health is stable enough to pursue the things I like. I'm back, and very happy to be back

### *28/06/2022 - "Java Básico" from Curso em Vídeo" IS FINISHED*
 Pratically after a month I've finished a basic free course of Java. I needed to remember some concepts and I wanted to start making some more pratical exercises. The "Curso em Vídeo" offered a great experience to me. I've learned how to make simple programs in Swing (and was introduced to JavaFX too). All of the pratices from this course are in "Pratical-exercises". Well, now I think that I've should have named it differently, but it will stay with that name. Now I'm aiming at lerning how to integrate my programs with databases. I'm feeling pretty confident.

### *23/08/2022 - "Python 3 – Mundo 1" from Curso em Vídeo IS FINISHED*
I've keeping a habit of trying to go through the basic courses. My rythm has been slower this past months, I'm struggling against my self-steem, but I'm trying not to lose the touch with programming. I've should have finished such basic course much faster, but at my current mental health I'm very proud to just have compleated something. I think I need to aim to more complex projects now, and I hope to keep this confidence.

This course is, again, from the "Curso em Vídeo". A very basic module with the fundamentals of using Python: how to install it, print messages in the terminal, do the basic operations, import modules, implement IF - ELSE conditions and other functions. 

The "Mundo 1" ("World 1") programs are present in the folder "Curso-em-Video-Pyhton". They cover the "aulas" ("classes") 5 to 11 and "exercicios" (excercises") 5 to 35.

### *30/08/2022 - "Python 3 – Mundo 2" from Curso em Vídeo IS FINISHED*
I've finished the next module of an introductory series of videos for Python 3. I've been distant from more complex projects for a while, but I'm slowly building up confidence to take on more advanced projects. I should mention that I'm recieving professional help for my emotional health and I recommend it for anyone needing it. I'm feeling great recently.

This course is, once more, from the "Curso em Vídeo". This module is a direct sequence from "Python 3 - Mundo 1", and develops more fundamental aspects of this language: the use of if/elif/else, for/while loops and the break function.

The "Mundo 2" ("World 2") programs are present in the folder "Curso-em-Video-Python". They cover the "aulas" ("classes") 12 to 15 and "exercicios" ("excercises") 36 to 71.

### *21/01/2023 - "Python 3 – Mundo 3" from Curso em Vídeo IS FINISHED
I was again a little off schedule. I still feel insecure about showing my studies and progress to the world, so being able to finally reach the end of the "Curso in Video" cycle is very rewarding.

This course is, once more, from the "Curso em Video". This module is a direct sequence from "Python 3 - Mundo 2". New Python elements are introduced here: tuples, lists, dictionaries, functions, modules, error handling, and basic file handling.

The "Mundo 3" ("World 3") programs are present in the folder "Curso-em-Video-Python". They cover the "aulas" ("classes") 16 to 23 and "exercicios" ("excercises") 72 to 115.
