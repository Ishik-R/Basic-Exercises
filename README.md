# Basic-Exercises
This repository is supposed to host the exercises i've completed in my initial process of learning

02/05/2021 - CREATION OF REPOSITORY
 I've already made some exercises but i haven't updated them here, so I'll start to upload them here; I'll mostly post exercises in Python and Java. At this moment, Python is my main interest because I'm interested in Data Science, but since my girlfriend is also learning to program I'm also helping her. My previous experiences in programming (because in Physics I've learn the basics concepts of programming in C++, Fortran, LaTex and MatLab, but since I never put this knowledge in pratice I've forgot most of them) are very helpful to her.
 
 29/05/2021 - UPDATE ON EXERCISES
 I've finished updating all exercises I've done till this very moment. I'm very busy because I've just finished moving from another city and I've stabilized my situation with my final paper, so I expect to put some more time in my studies in programming in the next weeks.
